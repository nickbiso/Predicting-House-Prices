# R-Predicting-House-Prices-
Predict housing prices in Ames, Iowa. Compare and contrast the different Machine Learning algorithms (Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, Neural Network, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine and Extreme Gradient Boosting). Explain their Philosophies and Methodologies. Test their strengths and weaknesses. Possibly ensemble the different models to produce a more accurate prediction. My role was to be the group leader. There was a presentation at the end of project.
